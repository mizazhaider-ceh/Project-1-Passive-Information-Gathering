# Passive Information Gathering - Project

## Author
**Muhammad Izaz Haider (Izaz)**

## Purpose of the Project

This project is my first attempt at performing **Passive Information Gathering** as part of ethical hacking and penetration testing. The goal of this project is to demonstrate the process of gathering publicly available information about a target website without directly interacting with the target. Passive Information Gathering is a legal and foundational step in security assessments and penetration testing.

For this project, I chose the website **[Mudassar Academy](https://mudassaracademy.com/)** and performed passive reconnaissance to gather the following information:

- Identifying IP addresses and DNS details
- Gathering domain ownership and domain-related information
- Identifying email addresses and social media profiles linked to the target
- Discovering the web technologies used on the target site
- Identifying subdomains

Various tools and techniques were utilized to gather this information and understand the structure of the target website.

## Introduction

Passive Information Gathering is a process of gathering information about a target system or website without actively engaging with it. This is a legal process and is the first step in most ethical hacking activities. By collecting publicly available data, we can assess the target’s vulnerabilities and plan further security assessments.

## Overview of Passive Information Gathering

In this project, the focus was on **Passive Information Gathering**, which includes techniques such as:

- Identifying details about the target website (e.g., IP addresses, DNS information, domain ownership)
- Gathering information from publicly accessible sources such as WHOIS, DNS records, and other publicly available databases
- Identifying technologies, social media profiles, email addresses, and subdomains related to the target website

## Target Website

The target website selected for this project is:  
**[Mudassar Academy](https://mudassaracademy.com/)**

This website was chosen as the subject for passive information gathering. The data collected will help demonstrate how passive information can be used to gain insights into the target.

## Tools and Techniques Used

The following tools and techniques were used during the project to gather passive information:

### Website Recon & Footprinting

   - **Screenshot**: ![Wappalyzer Screenshot](ScreenShots/6-wappalyzer-extension.png)

- **WhatWeb**  
   - **Use Case**: A next-gen web scanner to identify technologies used.
   - **Action**: Used WhatWeb to identify the target's web technologies.
   - **Screenshot**: ![WhatWeb Screenshot](ScreenShots/whatweb.png)

- **HTTrack**  
   - **Use Case**: To mirror the website for offline browsing, useful for penetration testing.
   - **Action**: Used HTTrack to copy the target website for offline use.
   - **Screenshot**: ![HTTrack Screenshot](ScreenShots/7-httrack.png)

### Whois Enumeration
